**Project 1: Movie Trailer Webpage**

Learning: In this project we are trying to implement OOP concepts in Python.  Running the entatinment.py file on your machine using the 

`python entatinment.py`

from the folder will generate a webpage that has information about my favourite movies. Clicking on any one of these images would play the movie trailer for that movie.

_Fresh_tomatoes.py_: generates the HTML page to display collection of movies (View)(Provided by Udacity)
_media.py_: this is where all the data is stored (Model)
_entatinment.py_: this python file has all the driving methods like creating instances and calling methods

Dependencies for this project:
**Python 2.x**
