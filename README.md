Project 1: Movie Trailer Webpage 

Learning: In this project we are trying to implement OOP concepts in Python.  Running the entatinment.py file on your machine using the command "python entatinment.py" from the folder will generate a webpage that has information about my favourite movies. Clicking on any one of these images would play the movie trailer for that movie.

Fresh_tomatoes.py: generates the HTML page to display collection of movies (View)(Provided by Udacity)
media.py: this is where all the data is stored (Model)
entatinment.py: this python file has all the driving methods like creating instances and calling methods

Dependencies for this project:
Python 2.x
